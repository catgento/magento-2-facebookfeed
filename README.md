# Facebook Feed generator for Magento 2

This is a very simple module that generates a csv file ready to be imported by Facebook Catalog.

It generates the basic needed data from the default store view.

## To improve

* Possibility to pass a parameter to select which store view should be exported
* Backoffice configuration to pass the basic parameters: currency, google category and other
* Add optional attributes to be exported

```
    composer require catgento/magento-2-facebookfeed
```
